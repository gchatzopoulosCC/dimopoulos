                        Over 50 different beers. Very good selection of local craft beers.  The burger is worthless.  The rest of the food was delicious.

                        Fabulous atmosphere, the place is spectacular and you feel like you are in a fairy tale. The big threeI full of candle in center is a breathtaking. I honestly thought the place was of a high standard, but the prices are affordable, cheaper that some bars on the sea side. The selection of beers is huge and the music they play is perfect. I hope I would have discovered this bar before

                        Very nice place! We were hungry and didn’t know where to go. The place is very nice, with pleasant music.
The food was great! Ordered a Tuna Wrap and a Ted Salad - absolutely delicious! The Tuna was so fresh! It also came with fries, but those fries...so good and fluffy! I totally recommend the Tuna Wrap.
The Ted Salad was delicious too. A very interesting and nice combination of tastes, I really liked it. Also ordered a frappe with more milk and I received just what I wanted. Great serving!
If you’re around this place, give it a try!

                        Enjoyable place works as a coffee bar and bar with nightly events playing live music about 22.30  , Plenty of suitable areas stands and stools in one section where there's a small stage, but the other room provides a more of a speak easy with books and games.
Prices are normal .Summer time has a outdoor garden area.
