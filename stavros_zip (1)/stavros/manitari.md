# Reviews

Name: Nicolas Taoussanis
Review: This is in my mind, one of the top restaurants in Greece. It could be top in Europe, and definitely deserves a Michelin star. Their take on “pastichio” is something out of this world! The crispy dumplings stuffed with oxtail were sublime. I would like to go back and just order 6-7 dishes off their starters menu. Portions are large, Staff are very friendly and exceptionally professional, without being pretentious. The spot has great ambience, nice and relaxed without being stuffy. If you are in Thessaloniki this is a must visit.

Review: The food is just perfection. The way the different flavors are chosen and blended together in a creative and visually pleasing way makes this a great restaurant. Combined with the lovely and professional server and the atmosphere and ambiance makes it a perfect restaurant. Vegetarian options: Would love to see how the chef would add more vegetarian options. I bet it will be even more perfect
