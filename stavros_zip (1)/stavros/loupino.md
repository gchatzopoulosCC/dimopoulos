Name: Igor Tratnik
Review: Absolutely beautiful and tasty food. Hard to get in in the evening as it is pretty packed. Service was nice, with a free Mastika drink at the end. Would recommend to anyone visiting Thessaloniki.

Name: Nir Drori
Review: Great place for dinner and lunch (we have been there twice dinner and lunch). The food is very tasty. The salads were huge and fresh. The cezar salad was with plenty grilled chicken bites and bacon. The Greek salad came with yogurt and Feta cheese. The ribeye steak was grilled to medium and it was tender and juicy. The service is excellent. Lots of traditional food, big portions, great atmosphere and the prices are very reasonable

Name: Bel
Review: We shared Seafood Risotto and Grilled Pork Belly and had to fight for the risotto. It was that good. Pork Belly was slight tough and the potato side wasn't that impressive. But do try the seafood risotto. Great conve isn't location and reservation can be made online.
